## Description
_______________________________________________
### AuthShield is a backend authentication system designed to implement secure user authentication and role-based authorization using token-based security mechanisms.
### AuthShield focuses on addressing common security requirements in backend systems by implementing authentication and authorization workflows. The project demonstrates how users authenticate using credentials and receive secure access tokens to interact with protected backend resources.
### The system uses role-based access control to restrict sensitive endpoints based on user roles. This models real-world enterprise scenarios where different users have different levels of access to system resources.
### The project emphasizes secure API design, token validation, and controlled access to backend services. AuthShield reflects foundational security practices required for building reliable and secure production-grade applications.
